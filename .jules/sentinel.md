## 2024-05-23 - Prevent Information Leakage in Error Responses
**Vulnerability:** The application was returning raw exception messages in HTTP 500 responses in `autogen_server.py`. This could expose sensitive internal details like stack traces, database schemas, or file paths to attackers.
**Learning:** FastAPI's `HTTPException` detail field is sent directly to the client. Developers often pass the exception string `str(e)` for convenience, not realizing it can contain sensitive info.
**Prevention:** Always catch exceptions, log the full details with `logger.error(..., exc_info=True)`, and raise `HTTPException` with a generic, static error message (e.g., "An internal error occurred").
