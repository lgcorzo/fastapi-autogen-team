## 2024-05-23 - Prevent Information Leakage in Error Responses
**Vulnerability:** The application was returning raw exception messages in HTTP 500 responses in `autogen_server.py`. This could expose sensitive internal details like stack traces, database schemas, or file paths to attackers.
**Learning:** FastAPI's `HTTPException` detail field is sent directly to the client. Developers often pass the exception string `str(e)` for convenience, not realizing it can contain sensitive info.
**Prevention:** Always catch exceptions, log the full details with `logger.error(..., exc_info=True)`, and raise `HTTPException` with a generic, static error message (e.g., "An internal error occurred").

## 2026-01-19 - Information Leakage in Exception Handling
**Vulnerability:** The application was leaking raw exception messages to clients in `serve_autogen`, `generate_streaming_response`, and `AutogenWorkflow.run`. This exposed internal details like variable names and system errors.
**Learning:** Exception handling blocks were catching `Exception as e` and including `f"{e}"` directly in the `HTTPException` detail or response payload.
**Prevention:** Always sanitize error messages returned to clients. Use generic messages like "An internal error occurred" and log the full exception details server-side with `exc_info=True`.
